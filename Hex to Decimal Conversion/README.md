## What is Hexadecimal

**Hexadecimal** (often abbreviated as "hex") is a base-16 number system used to represent numbers. It uses sixteen distinct symbols: the ten decimal digits (0-9) and the six extra symbols (A, B, C, D, E, F) to represent values from 10 to 15.

In hexadecimal, each digit position represents a power of 16, starting from the rightmost digit. For example:

1st position (rightmost): Represents 16^0 (1)
2nd position: Represents 16^1 (16)
3rd position: Represents 16^2 (256)
And so on.

Hexadecimal is commonly used in computing because it can represent large numbers in a more compact form than decimal. It's particularly useful in representing memory addresses, color codes, and binary data. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary digits (bits), making it convenient for representing binary values in a human-readable format.
